The 'Tech Careers Panel' event will bring together speakers with various IT career experiences to discuss their education paths, entry to employment, and current positions. The event will be faciliated by an MC, with prepared questions to open the discussion and ad-hoc questions contributed by the audience later in the event.   

You can add prepared question submissions for the panelists in the 'Issues' tab of this Github Project.
